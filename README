# Update v0.2

## Redundancy
- Added two more VM machines (Web3 and Web4) for full HA solution. Now Web1 and Web2 machines works as a main traffic handlers, and Web3 with Web4 as a test/backup traffic handlers.

## HealthCheck
- Added healthcheck script which works in a background. It cooperates with redeploy script.
  - You can Enable or Disable it from ./deployment script choosing option "6. Run/Stop HealthCheck process".

## Auto redeploy
- Added Redeploy script which works in a background. It cooperates with healthcheck script. If one of the main machine doesn't forward traffic, then it starts auto redeploying web1 and web2 machines, then reenabling healthcheck script again.
  - Script availability enables automatically with healthcheck script, so don't forget to enable it first.

## Added Logging
- Healthcheck and Auto redeploy scripts automatically logging outputs into /scripts/healthcheck.log and /scripts/redeploy.log files.
  - Function automatically starts working when healthcheck script is enabled.
